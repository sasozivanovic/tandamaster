# Installation

Arch Linux: TandaMaster is available via AUR.

Other: `pip install TandaMaster`

# Configuration

The program can only be configured by manually editing a [TOML](https://toml.io) file.

After the program is run for the first time, it will copy the initial
configuration file to the standard location.  On Linux:
`.config/MilongueroSi/TandaMaster/config.toml`. See the comments in the file
itself for more information.  Note that this is where you set up library
folders.

The library database (`tandamaster.db`, in sqlite3 format), the global playtree
containing all the playtrees (`playtree.xml`) and the UI configuration
(`ui.xml`) reside in `.local/share/MilongueroSi/TandaMaster/config.toml`.
